# htmlz-mode

This is a small, dead-simple, Emacs minor mode that shows a live
preview of a html document as you work on it. This is inspired by the
live preview option for the Brackets text editor. This is very useful
if you want to get live feedback while you work on a webpage.

It basically works like this:

1. Create a temporary html file.
2. Start a websocket server in Emacs.
3. Place some Javascript in that file that opens a websocket
   connection with Emacs.
4. Open the temporary file in the default browser.
5. When the buffer contents change send the new buffer contents over
   the websocket connection from Emacs.
6. When a new websocket message is received in the browser, update the
   page contents with that message.
   
This is my first Emacs Lisp program ever so it's likely to do some
things in a less-than-ideal way.

At the moment, this does not support refreshing when associated files
(think css files) are edited. Adding this likely wouldn't be too
difficult as we could just parse the first html document whenver a new
buffer was opened and updated some sort of "dependency tree".
