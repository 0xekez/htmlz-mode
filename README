# htmlz-mode

This is a small, dead-simple, Emacs minor mode that shows a live
preview of a html document as you work on it. This is inspired by the
live preview option for the Brackets text editor. This is very useful
if you want to get live feedback while you work on a webpage.

It basically works like this:

1. Create a temporary html file.
2. Start a websocket server in Emacs.
3. Place some Javascript in that file that opens a websocket
   connection with Emacs.
4. Open the temporary file in the default browser.
5. When the buffer contents change send the new buffer contents over
   the websocket connection from Emacs.
6. When a new websocket message is received in the browser, update the
   page contents with that message.
   
This is my first Emacs Lisp program ever so it's likely to do some
things in a less-than-ideal way.

There are a couple things it does not support:

1. Editing associated CSS/JS files in emacs will not cause the preview
   to update.
2. Relative paths do not work becuase the temporary file it creates
   lives in `/tmp/`.
   
I intend to fix those problems soon as they are must have features in
order for this to be useful to me.
